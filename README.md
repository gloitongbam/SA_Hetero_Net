Sentiment classification on Twitter text often needs to deal with the problems of under-specificity, noise, and multilingual content.
In this study, we propose a heterogeneous multi-layer network-based representation of tweets to generate multiple representations of a tweet and address the above issues. The generated representations are further ensembled and classified using a neural-based early fusion approach. Further, we propose a centrality aware random-walk for node embedding and tweet representations suitable for the multi-layer network.
From various experimental analyses, it is evident that the proposed method can address the problem of under-specificity, noisy text, and multilingual content present in a tweet and provides better classification performance than the text-based counterpart.
Further, the proposed centrality aware based random walk provides better representations than unbiased and other biased counterparts.
